I have commit a set of windows scripts used to monitor a mining rig.

I am using https://ethermine.org API for retrieving stats and send them via email.

I utilized the JsonRPC endpoint for reading the stats of the miner and if something is wrong (ex. 0 h/s), the ethminer is restarted.

Happy sharing!
