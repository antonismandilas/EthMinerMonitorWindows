# EthMinerMonitorWindows
__________________________________________________________________________________________

Here you can find a set of windows scripts used to monitor a mining rig.

For get pool statistics the API from https://ethermine.org is used and the results are sent via email.

There is also an implementation for invoking JsonRPC endpoint and read the current statistics of the ethminer. In case something is wrong (ex. 0 h/s), the ethminer is restarted automatically.

Happy sharing!
